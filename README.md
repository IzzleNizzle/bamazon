## How it works :boom:

* There are two files

1. bamazonCustomer.js for the customer view.

2. bamazonManager.js for the manager view

* The bamazonCustomer.js app prompts users with two messages;

   1. The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   2. The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.

* I my your store has enough of the product, it will fulfill the customer's order.

* The bamazonManager.js app list a set of menu options:

1. View Products for Sale

2. View Low Inventory

3. Add to Inventory

4. Add New Product


* If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app will list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

* If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it will list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

* If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, the app will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

* If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it will allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
